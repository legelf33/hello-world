# hello-world
  My first time on the hub.  I've been obtaining file from the hub for a while now and have made the choice to join.  I am not a professional, the only code I write in my professional life is G-code for CNC machines.  Personally I have used many other languages but only for private use.  The purpose of my joining the 'GitHub' is to learn, not only languages but also the entire process of project creation and maintenance.  My introduction to 'OSS' started with 'Mandrake' Linux back in the mid 1990's.  Setting up 'Mandrake' and various other distros' opened my eyes' to the world of 'OSS'.  To be able to go in and see the source code, scrutinize the code, edit the code then recompile it was revolutionary to me.  This is the way computing was meant to be!
  I have built all my computers from day one (1989-present) and it only seems natural to me that the software should be the same. In my opinion that is the best way to learn, dig in, tear it apart and reassemble.
